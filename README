Various dotfiles (rc's) that I personally use.

Bash:
 - bashrc
 - bash_profile

Readline:
 - inputrc

I put these in a hidden directory on a host, and then symlink the actual dotfiles to them, like:

ln -s ~/.settings/bashrc ~/.bashrc

Environment-specific things are sourced in bash_profile from local/bash_profile if it exists.

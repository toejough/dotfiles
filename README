Various dotfiles (rc's) that I personally use.

Bash:
 - bashrc
 - bash_profile
 - .bashrc
 - .bash_profile

Readline:
 - inputrc

I put these in ~/.settings directory on a host, and then symlink the actual dotfiles to them, like:

ln -s ~/.settings/.bashrc ~/.bashrc

The dot versions call the .settings versions, as well as .settings.local versions, for local customizations.

The rc's are expected to have logic needed for every interactive shell.
The profiles are expected to have logic needed only once each login.
